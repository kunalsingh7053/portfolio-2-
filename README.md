# Kunal Patel — Portfolio (React + Tailwind)

This is a modern, animated portfolio built with React, Vite, TailwindCSS and Framer Motion.

## Features
- React + Vite fast dev server
- TailwindCSS for utility-first styling
- Framer Motion animations, glassmorphism cards, gradients
- Responsive, mobile-first layout

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd portfolio/react-portfolio
npm install
```

2. Run dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Notes: The contact form is simulated client-side. Replace with a serverless endpoint or Formspree for real submissions.

If you want, I can:
- Add a theme switcher that persists in localStorage
- Add Lottie animations and GSAP interactions
- Integrate a real contact backend
